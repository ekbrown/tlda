\description{
This function calculates a number of parts-based dispersion measures and allows the user to choose the directionality of scaling, i.e. whether higher values denote a more even or a less even distribution. It also offers the option of calculating frequency-adjusted dispersion scores.
}
\details{
This function calculates dispersion measures based on two vectors: a set of subfrequencies (number of occurrences of the item in each corpus part) and a matching set of part sizes (the size of the corpus parts, i.e. number of word tokens).
\itemize{
\item Directionality: The scores for all measures range from 0 to 1. The conventional scaling of dispersion measures (see Juilland & Chang-Rodriguez 1964; Carroll 1970; Rosengren 1971) assigns higher values to more even/dispersed/balanced distributions of subfrequencies across corpus parts. This is the default. Gries (2008) uses the reverse scaling, with higher values denoting a more uneven/bursty/concentrated distribution; use \code{directionality = "gries"} to choose this option.
\item Frequency adjustment: Dispersion scores can be adjusted for frequency using the min-max transformation proposed by Gries (2022: 184-191; 2024: 196-208). The frequency-adjusted score for an  item considers the lowest and highest possible level of dispersion it can obtain given its overall corpus frequency as well as the number (and size) of corpus parts. The unadjusted score is then expressed relative to these endpoints, where the dispersion minimum is set to 0, and the dispersion maximum to 1 (expressed in terms of conventional scaling). The frequency-adjusted score falls between these bounds and expresses how close the observed distribution is to the theoretical maximum and minimum. This adjustment therefore requires a maximally and a minimally dispersed distribution of the item across the parts. These hypothetical extremes can be built in different ways. The method used by Gries (2022, 2024) uses a computationally expensive procedure that finds the distribution that produces the highest value on the dispersion measure of interest. The current function constructs extreme distributions in a different way, based on the distributional features pervasiveness (\code{"pervasive"}) or evenness (\code{"even"}). You can choose between these with the argument \code{freq_adjust_method}; the default is \code{even}. For details and explanations, see \code{vignette("frequency-adjustment")}.
\itemize{
\item To obtain the lowest possible level of dispersion, the occurrences are either allocated to as few corpus parts as possible (\code{"pervasive"}), or they are assigned to the smallest corpus part(s) (\code{"even"}).
\item To obtain the highest possible level of dispersion, the occurrences are either spread as broadly across corpus parts as possible (\code{"pervasive"}), or they are allocated to corpus parts in proportion to their size (\code{"even"}). The choice between these methods is particularly relevant if corpus parts differ considerably in size. See documentation for \code{find_max_disp()} and \code{vignette("frequency-adjustment")}.

}

The following measures are computed, listed in chronological order (see details below):
\itemize{
\item \eqn{R_{rel}} (Keniston 1920)
\item \eqn{D} (Juilland & Chang-Rodriguez 1964)
\item \eqn{D_2} (Carroll 1970)
\item \eqn{S} (Rosengren 1971)
\item \eqn{D_P} (Gries 2008; modification: Egbert et al. 2020)
\item \eqn{D_A} (Burch et al. 2017)
\item \eqn{D_{KL}} (Gries 2024)
}

In the formulas given below, the following notation is used:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{k} the number of corpus parts
\item \eqn{T_i} the absolute subfrequency in part \eqn{i}
\item \eqn{t_i} a proportional quantity; the subfrequency in part \eqn{i} divided by the total number of occurrences of the item in the corpus (i.e. the sum of all subfrequencies)
\item \eqn{W_i} the absolute size of corpus part \eqn{i}
\item \eqn{w_i} a proportional quantity; the size of corpus part \eqn{i} divided by the size of the corpus (i.e. the sum of the part sizes)
\item \eqn{R_i} the normalized subfrequency in part \eqn{i}, i.e. the subfrequency divided by the size of the corpus part
\item \eqn{r_i} a proportional quantity; the normalized subfrequency in part \eqn{i} divided by the sum of all normalized subfrequencies
\item \eqn{N} corpus frequency, i.e. the total number of occurrence of the item in the corpus
}

Note that the formulas cited below differ in their scaling, i.e. whether 1 reflects an even or an uneven distribution. In the current function, this behavior is overridden by the argument \code{directionality}. The specific scaling used in the formulas below is therefore irrelevant.

\eqn{R_{rel}} refers to the relative range, i.e. the proportion of corpus parts containing at least one occurrence of the item.

\eqn{D} denotes Juilland's D and is calculated as follows (this formula uses conventional scaling); \eqn{\bar{R_i}} refers to the average over the normalized subfrequencies:

\eqn{1 - \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^k (R_i - \bar{R_i})^2}{k}} \times \frac{1}{\bar{R_i} \sqrt{k - 1}}}

\eqn{D_2} denotes the index proposed by Carroll (1970); the following formula uses conventional scaling:

\eqn{\frac{\sum_i^k r_i \log_2{\frac{1}{r_i}}}{\log_2{k}}}

\eqn{S} is the dispersion measure proposed by Rosengren (1971); the formula uses conventional scaling:

\eqn{\frac{(\sum_i^k r_i \sqrt{w_i T_i}}{N}}

\eqn{D_P} represents Gries's deviation of proportions; the following formula is the modified version suggested by Egbert et al. (2020: 99); it implements conventional scaling (0 = uneven, 1 = even) and the notation \eqn{min\{w_i: t_i > 0\}} refers to the \eqn{w_i} value among those corpus parts that include at least one occurrence of the item.

\eqn{1 - \frac{\sum_i^k |t_i - w_i|}{2} \times \frac{1}{1 - min\{w_i: t_i > 0\}}}

\eqn{D_A} is a measure introduced into dispersion analysis by Burch et al. (2017). The following formula is the one used by Egbert et al. (2020: 98); it relies on normalized frequencies and therefore works with corpus parts of different size. The formula represents conventional scaling (0 = uneven, 1 = even):

\eqn{1 - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k-1} \sum_{j = i+1}^{k} |R_i - R_j|}{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} \times \frac{1}{2\frac{\sum_i^k R_i}{k}}}

The current function uses a different version of the same formula, which relies on the proportional \eqn{r_i} values instead of the normalized subfrequencies \eqn{R_i}. This version yields the identical result:

\eqn{1 - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k-1} \sum_{j = i+1}^{k} |r_i - r_j|}{k-1}}

\eqn{D_{KL}} refers to a measure proposed by Gries (2020, 2021); for standardization, it uses the odds-to-probability transformation (Gries 2024: 90) and represents Gries scaling (0 = even, 1 = uneven):

\eqn{\frac{\sum_i^k t_i \log_2{\frac{t_i}{w_i}}}{1 + \sum_i^k t_i \log_2{\frac{t_i}{w_i}}}}
