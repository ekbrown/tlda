\description{
This function calculates the dispersion measure 'range'. It offers three different versions: 'absolute range' (the number of corpus parts containing at least one occurrence of the item), 'relative range' (the proportion of corpus parts containing at least one occurrence of the item), and 'relative range with size' (relative range that takes into account the size of the corpus parts). The function also offers the option of calculating frequency-adjusted dispersion scores.
}
\details{
The function calculates the dispersion measure 'range' based on a set of subfrequencies (number of occurrences of the item in each corpus part) and a matching set of part sizes (the size of the corpus parts, i.e. number of word tokens). Three different types of range measures can be calculated:
\itemize{
\item Absolute range: The number of corpus parts containing at least one occurrence of the item
\item Relative range: The proportion of corpus parts containing at least one occurrence of the item; this version of 'range' follows the conventional scaling of dispersion measures (1 = widely dispersed)
\item Relative range with size (see Gries 2022: 179-180; Gries 2024: 27-28): Relative range that takes into account the size of the corpus parts. Each corpus part contributes to this version of range in proportion to its size. Suppose there are 100 corpus parts, and part 1 is relatively short, accounting for 1/200 of the words in the whole corpus. If the item occurs in part 1, ordinary relative range increases by 1/100, since each part receives the same weight. Relative range with size, on the other hand, increases by 1/200, i.e. the relative size of the corpus part; this version of range weights corpus parts proportionate to their size.
\item Frequency adjustment: Dispersion scores can be adjusted for frequency using the min-max transformation proposed by Gries (2022: 184-191; 2024: 196-208). The frequency-adjusted score for an  item considers the lowest and highest possible level of dispersion it can obtain given its overall corpus frequency as well as the number (and size) of corpus parts. The unadjusted score is then expressed relative to these endpoints, where the dispersion minimum is set to 0, and the dispersion maximum to 1 (expressed in terms of conventional scaling). The frequency-adjusted score falls between these bounds and expresses how close the observed distribution is to the theoretical maximum and minimum. This adjustment therefore requires a maximally and a minimally dispersed distribution of the item across the parts. These hypothetical extremes can be built in different ways. The method used by Gries (2022, 2024) uses a computationally expensive procedure that finds the distribution that produces the highest value on the dispersion measure of interest. The current function constructs extreme distributions in a different way, based on the distributional features pervasiveness (\code{"pervasive"}) or evenness (\code{"even"}). You can choose between these with the argument \code{freq_adjust_method}; the default is \code{even}. For details and explanations, see \code{vignette("frequency-adjustment")}.
\itemize{
\item To obtain the lowest possible level of dispersion, the occurrences are either allocated to as few corpus parts as possible (\code{"pervasive"}), or they are assigned to the smallest corpus part(s) (\code{"even"}).
\item To obtain the highest possible level of dispersion, the occurrences are either spread as broadly across corpus parts as possible (\code{"pervasive"}), or they are allocated to corpus parts in proportion to their size (\code{"even"}). The choice between these methods is particularly relevant if corpus parts differ considerably in size. See documentation for \code{find_max_disp()}.
