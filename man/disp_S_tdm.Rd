\arguments{
\item{tdm}{A term-document matrix, where rows represent items and columns represent corpus parts; must also contain a row giving the size of the corpus parts (first or last row in the term-document matrix)}

\item{row_partsize}{Character string indicating which row in the term-document matrix contains the size of the corpus parts. Possible values are \code{"first"} (default) and \code{"last"}}

\item{directionality}{Character string indicating the directionality of scaling. See details below. Possible values are \code{"conventional"} (default) and \code{"gries"}}

\item{freq_adjust}{Logical. Whether dispersion score should be adjusted for frequency (i.e. whether frequency should be 'partialed out'); default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{freq_adjust_method}{Character string indicating which method to use for devising dispersion extremes. See details below. Possible values are \code{"even"} (default) and \code{"pervasive"}}

\item{unit_interval}{Logical. Whether frequency-adjusted scores that exceed the limits of the unit interval should be replaced by 0 and 1; default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{digits}{Rounding: Integer value specifying the number of decimal places to retain (default: no rounding)}

\description{
This function calculates the dispersion measure \eqn{S} (Rosengren 1971) and allows the user to choose the directionality of scaling, i.e. whether higher values denote a more even or a less even distribution. It also offers the option of calculating frequency-adjusted dispersion scores.
}
\details{
This function takes as input a term-document matrix and returns, for each item (i.e. each row) the dispersion measure \eqn{S}. The rows in the matrix represent the items, and the columns the corpus parts. Importantly, the term-document matrix must include an additional row that records the size of the corpus parts. For a proper term-document matrix, which includes all items that appear in the corpus, this can be added as a column margin, which sums the frequencies in each column. If the matrix only includes a selection of items drawn from the corpus, this information cannot be derived from the matrix and must be provided as a separate row.
\itemize{
\item Directionality: \eqn{S} ranges from 0 to 1. The conventional scaling of dispersion measures (see Juilland & Chang-Rodriguez 1964; Carroll 1970; Rosengren 1971) assigns higher values to more even/dispersed/balanced distributions of subfrequencies across corpus parts. This is the default. Gries (2008) uses the reverse scaling, with higher values denoting a more uneven/bursty/concentrated distribution; use \code{directionality = 'gries'} to choose this option.
\item Frequency adjustment: Dispersion scores can be adjusted for frequency using the min-max transformation proposed by Gries (2022: 184-191; 2024: 196-208). The frequency-adjusted score for an  item considers the lowest and highest possible level of dispersion it can obtain given its overall corpus frequency as well as the number (and size) of corpus parts. The unadjusted score is then expressed relative to these endpoints, where the dispersion minimum is set to 0, and the dispersion maximum to 1 (expressed in terms of conventional scaling). The frequency-adjusted score falls between these bounds and expresses how close the observed distribution is to the theoretical maximum and minimum. This adjustment therefore requires a maximally and a minimally dispersed distribution of the item across the parts. These hypothetical extremes can be built in different ways. The method used by Gries (2022, 2024) uses a computationally expensive procedure that finds the distribution that produces the highest value on the dispersion measure of interest. The current function constructs extreme distributions in a different way, based on the distributional features pervasiveness (\code{pervasive}) or evenness (\code{even}). You can choose between these with the argument \code{freq_adjust_method}; the default is \code{even}. For details and explanations, see \code{vignette("frequency-adjustment")}.
\itemize{
\item To obtain the lowest possible level of dispersion, the occurrences are either allocated to as few corpus parts as possible (\code{pervasive}), or they are assigned to the smallest corpus part(s) (\code{even}).
\item To obtain the highest possible level of dispersion, the occurrences are either spread as broadly across corpus parts as possible (\code{pervasive}), or they are allocated to corpus parts in proportion to their size (\code{even}). The choice between these methods is particularly relevant if corpus parts differ considerably in size. See documentation for \code{find_max_disp()}.

In the formulas given below, the following notation is used:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{k}   the number of corpus parts
\item \eqn{T_i}   the absolute subfrequency in part \eqn{i}
\item \eqn{w_i} a proportional quantity; the size of corpus part \eqn{i} divided by the size of the corpus (i.e. the sum of the part sizes)
}

\eqn{S} is the dispersion measure proposed by Rosengren (1971); the formula uses conventional scaling:

  \eqn{\frac{(\sum_i^k r_i \sqrt{w_i T_i}}{N}}
